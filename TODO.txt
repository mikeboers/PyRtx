- make minimally viable SO that exposes the Rtx API
  - how to get PRMan to use it?





---

- embed Python into a RSL shadeop
    
    python_call('package.module:function', Nn, P)
    python_exec('import mymodule; return mymodule.something(%s, %s)', Nn, P)

    - Should there be seperate functions for passing numpy arrays of data,
      should they all do that, or should they all call for each point?

- expose all functions of the PRMan C APIs
- expose all RSL functions (via suspending the calling thread via greenlets,
  dispatching back to RSL, computing what was requested, and resuming the
  Python thread).

- make sure it works multithreaded

- make the demos generally only run in the shader constructor so that there
  isn't a lot of overhead:
    - render some tweets (can we do fonts, or do we have some sort of
      html to png library?)
    - grab an image from flickr
    - grab images from google streetview
      https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/
      cube maps from 90° sections? http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?size=800x800&location=40.7201,%20-73.988354&fov=90&heading=90&pitch=0&sensor=false
    - grab tweets with GPS data, and render them with reflections from where they were taken

      
- Create a Rtx plugin so that Python can provide texture data.

- we can take varargs, and there is an RslContext!
- expose numpy arrays, and or lists of data?
