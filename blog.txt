RTx plugins are accessed via a texture named:

    "rtxplugin:<SO name>?key=value"

This can be an absolute path, or is searched for on the texture path (of all places).

When you iterate over the tileData pointer, go:
    for y in yrange:
        for x in xrange:
            for c in crange:
                ...

req.tile.offset is the tile index, not the pixel offset; multiple by the tile
size in order to get the pixel offset.
